# Plants by Aaron
This is my first go at making my own landing page. The layout is partially inspired by several tutorial website layouts that Iâ€™ve seen.
The theme of this page is a fake plant shop in Washington State.

## To Do:
- [ ] Add email signup functionality
- [ ] Finish pages in nav bar
- [ ] Potentially add both shop and cart functionality
